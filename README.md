# Supply-chain-Analysis
Based on the analysis of the given dataset, it is evident that there is a wealth of information that can be extracted to gain insights into the supply chain operations. 
Through the use of various visualizations, we were able to identify
the most popular products,
revenue generation, 
transportation modes,
shipping costs,
lead times,
manufacturing costs,
among other metrics.

This analysis can help inform strategic decision-making and identify areas for improvement in the supply chain operations. For example,
it may be possible to optimize inventory management, 
reduce waste and inefficiencies,
improve product quality,
reduce carbon emissions,
strengthen supplier relationships
